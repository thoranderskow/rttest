Created using ReactJS.
All components found in src/components.
Responses to reviews stored at jsonbin.io.
Since this was a frontend challenge and not a real web application, it was easiest to make requests to jsonbin.io client-side.
There is a key in the code that should be set as an environment variable.
The reviews were loaded in programatically in Body.js. Hosted on heroku at https://review-test-tanderskow.herokuapp.com/.
